This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and attempting to render items with a unique key prop that is not actually unique. This often happens when the data source changes, and the keys aren't properly updated to reflect those changes.  The error message itself can vary slightly but typically involves the "key" prop and mentions that it's not unique.  Here's an example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 2' }]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} //id is not unique
/>
```
